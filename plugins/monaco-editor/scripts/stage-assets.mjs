/**
 * Builds the Monaco bundle this plugin serves, into `dist/monaco`.
 *
 * Monaco cannot go through `bb plugin build` with everything else: that
 * config emits one file with no code splitting, so Monaco would parse at app
 * boot for every user — including everyone who never opens a file — and its
 * worker could not be emitted at all. Building it here instead keeps it
 * lazy: `lib/monaco-loader.ts` imports these files from a
 * `files.createPreview` URL the first time a file tab opens.
 *
 * Building rather than copying Monaco's prebuilt AMD bundle is what keeps
 * this small. esbuild proves which modules are reachable from the entry, so
 * the language services this plugin does not use are dropped by construction
 * — 3.3 MB against 24 MB for the AMD tree — with no risk that something we
 * pruned is requested later at runtime.
 *
 * Packaging ships only a builtin's `dist/` and `skills/`
 * (`bb-plugin-build prepare-bundled`, which runs this), so
 * `dist/` is the only place these files can live.
