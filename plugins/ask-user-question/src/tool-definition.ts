export const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool only when you are blocked on a decision that is genuinely the user's to make: one you cannot resolve from the request, the code, or sensible defaults.

Usage notes:
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide custom text input
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label

Reserve this for decisions where the user's answer changes what you do next — not for choices with a conventional default or facts you can verify in the codebase yourself. In those cases pick the obvious option, mention it in your response, and proceed.

Preview feature:
Use the optional \`preview\` field on options when presenting concrete artifacts that users need to visually compare:
- ASCII mockups of UI layouts or components
- Code snippets showing different implementations
- Diagram variations
- Configuration examples

Preview content is rendered as markdown in a monospace box. Multi-line text with newlines is supported. The preview is revealed beneath an option once it is selected. Do not use previews for simple preference questions where labels and descriptions suffice. Note: previews are only supported for single-select questions (not multiSelect).

  "This call included a question with fewer than 2 options, so it was rejected and the person never saw it. A question with a single option has no decision in it. Do not retry this call and do not invent a filler second option. Instead, state the one path you were going to offer as the approach you are taking, then continue with the task. If this call also contained questions with 2 to 4 options (each with distinct labels), you may re-ask those questions alone in a new call. Ask a question only when the person has at least two genuinely distinct choices.";
