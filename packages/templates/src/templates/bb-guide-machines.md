Machine commands

A host is an identity and daemon connection. A machine is a host with a
provider-owned lifecycle. The local host has no machine provider. Every other
host is a machine, including existing machines enrolled with the built-in
`manual` provider (Manual machine setup). Add machines under Settings → Machines
or from the composer machine picker.

The server listens on loopback by default. Remote execution machines need
a server access provider: paired bb Connect, or a configured direct URL reachable
from the target, such as a private Tailscale Serve URL. A configured URL alone
does not prove reachability.

The Settings installer first uses the exact `bb-app` tarball served by that bb
server at `/install/bb-app.tgz`; only servers that do not implement the route
(HTTP 404) fall back to the npm registry. npm installs bb-app under this
machine enrollment's bb data directory, so the installer needs neither `sudo`
nor a global npm configuration. Installed launchd/systemd services pass
`--auto-update`. On a newer server protocol mismatch, the daemon downloads that
same artifact, updates its private install, and exits for the service manager to
restart. Failed attempts use a persisted exponential backoff that starts at 5
seconds and caps at 5 minutes. A daemon never auto-downgrades to an older server
protocol. Use Settings → Machines or `bb machine retry-update` to bypass the
current backoff after a transient failure.

To opt out, remove `--auto-update` from the launchd plist or systemd user unit
and reload that service. Foreground/manual `bb-app host-daemon` runs leave it off
unless you pass `--auto-update` explicitly.

`bb-app`, `bb-server`, and `bb-host-daemon` capture service stdout and stderr
directly under the selected data directory in `logs/server-stdio.log` and
`logs/host-daemon-stdio.log`. These files append across restarts and contain
console output and startup errors; rotating application logs remain separate.
Use `tail -F` to follow them without coupling service logging to the terminal.

Each machine has a permission limit: the highest permission mode any thread on
that machine can run with. The default is Full Access. A thread that asks for
more resolves down to the limit, and a provider that supports no mode under the
limit cannot run there. Set it in Settings → Machines → the machine → Permission
limit; that page also shows the machine's projects, provider CLIs, update state,
and rename/remove. There is no CLI or SDK command to set it, and a paired
machine cannot set it for any machine, so a sandbox machine can stay at Full
Access while your laptop stays lower. `bb machine list --json` and `bb machine
show` report the current limit.

Standalone create does not create a thread or workspace. Omit inputs to use the
provider defaults; supply JSON when its schema requires additional values. Omit
`--key` to let the server generate one, or supply a stable key for retries.
Creation is durable:
`--no-wait` returns the creating host ID immediately; otherwise the CLI polls
that host until active. SIGINT stops following and exits 130 while creation
continues. `bb machine list` includes machines still being created. It lists persistent
machines only; pass `--all` to include the disposable sandboxes that
environment providers create per thread.
Use `bb machine show <host-id>` to inspect progress and `bb machine
remove <host-id>` to cancel and clean up. The SDK provides
`hosts.experimental_create`; pass `wait: false` to receive the creating host and
poll it with `hosts.get`. Aborting a caller signal never cancels the server operation. A connected daemon does not
yet imply an agent-ready checkout and authenticated provider.

Suspend and resume are available only when the machine provider implements
both operations. Retry cleanup is accepted only for a retiring machine whose
provider teardown failed.

Updates commands

One consolidated view of bb and provider CLI updates across machines — the
CLI counterpart of Settings → Updates and the sidebar Updates badge.

bb updates [status] Show bb-app and provider CLI update
status for every machine
--machine <id-or-name> Limit to one machine
--json Print the aggregate as JSON
bb updates apply Run every available provider CLI
install/update, one at a time
--machine <id-or-name> Limit to one machine
--json Print per-target results as JSON

`bb updates apply` covers provider CLIs only. Update bb-app itself with the
printed upgrade command (`npx bb-app@latest`) or the desktop app's relaunch;
connected daemons then follow the server version automatically.

Machine selectors accept either an exact machine ID or an unambiguous machine
name. `--host` is an alias for `--machine`.

bb thread spawn --project <id> --machine <id-or-name> --prompt "..."
bb thread spawn --project <id> --new-machine <provider-id> --prompt "..."
--machine-inputs <json>
bb project create --name "..." --root <path> --machine <id-or-name>
bb project source add <projectId> --machine <id-or-name> --path <path>

For thread spawning, machine targeting works with an unmanaged workspace path,
a new managed worktree, or the personal workspace. Do not combine it with an
existing environment ID: the reused environment already selects its machine.
`--new-machine` creates through a machine provider and uses its advertised
environment row when declared. Otherwise add `--environment-provider <id>`
(required for SSH). Use `--environment-inputs <json>` for workspace configuration,
separately from `--machine-inputs <json>`. Machine inputs are persisted and
readable by plugins; never put secrets there. Store credentials in plugin settings and pass only
non-secret configuration or references.

When `--new-machine` selects an environment provider requiring a project
checkout, core clones the project's Git remote and registers a source on the
connected machine before creating that environment. Existing sources are reused.
Automatic setup uses a stable per-project target and shares concurrent setup on
the same host. After a server restart, it registers a completed checkout whose
remote matches instead of cloning again; a conflicting target is refused.
The project needs a Git remote and the machine needs Git access to it. Choosing
Personal workspace first does not clone a project. Standalone `bb machine create`
does not set up a project source and remains available until explicitly removed.
Machines created for threads retire after their last live thread is archived
when the provider declares them ephemeral.

For project creation and sources, `--root`/`--path` refers to a path on the
selected connected machine. Omit the selector to keep the existing local CLI
machine fallback (normally the primary machine). Pass `--clone` to source add
instead of `--path` to clone the project's Git remote there; `--remote-url` and
`--target-path` optionally override the clone inputs.

## Server access

Set Machines → Server URL reachable by machines, or run `bb settings general
machineServerUrl https://bb.example.com`. An unset value uses BB_EXTERNAL_URL.
Select Manual to show the URL input. Set Default machine access with
`bb settings general defaultMachineAccess direct` or `connect`; `null` uses
the first registered access provider, or direct when none is registered. An
unpaired provider reports setup required. `bb settings show --json` includes
fresh provider availability and the effective selection; failed or timed-out
checks report unavailable without acquiring a grant. Settings and creation
banners refresh this status when the access provider signals a change. Machines use this
access for ongoing runtime requests, including account-pool endpoints.

The Tailscale plugin can supply private machine access without a Direct URL.
Use `bb tailscale devices`, `bb tailscale status`, and `bb tailscale configure
<port>` to discover devices and validate a dedicated existing HTTPS Serve
mapping. Choose Tailscale explicitly; it is not selected by default.
The plugin skill documents SSH prerequisites and safe endpoint cleanup.

## Local daemon lifecycle

`install-machine.sh --start|--stop|--uninstall --host-id <id>` starts, stops or removes an
owned local installation. Optional `--server-url <url>` and `--data-dir <path>`
assert the expected installation. BB_DATA_DIR is treated as an assertion too.
An identity mismatch refuses the operation. These commands are local machine
primitives; `bb machine remove` asks the server to remove the provider resource.
They verify the canonical installer-owned directory, enrolled identity, and
service or process ownership before acting. Stop and uninstall safely succeed
when no matching installation exists; start requires an installation. They
refuse the default BB data directory. Stopping a daemon is distinct from
`bb machine suspend`, which invokes provider suspension and polls until the machine
is paused. `bb machine resume` likewise waits for provider restore and bootstrap.

## Enroll a preinstalled machine

`bb machine enroll --bootstrap-file <path>` or `bb machine enroll --bootstrap-env <NAME>` consumes a versioned private enrollment bundle prepared by core. Supply exactly one source. The environment source is removed from the CLI process environment after reading it; files remain under the caller's ownership. Neither command prints the bundle or credentials.

The CLI refuses another host or server identity in the selected machine directory. Repeating enrollment with the same persisted identity succeeds without exchanging the credential again, including when the original bundle expired. Machine data defaults to `~/.bb-machines/<server-host>`; `BB_DATA_DIR` can select another isolated machine directory, but enrollment refuses the default `~/.bb` directory.

The manual copy command fetches `/install.sh` using a short-lived `X-BB-Enrollment` header. The server supplies the bootstrap only for a pending, unexpired, uncancelled manual enrollment whose credential has not been consumed; downloaded responses are not cached. The command contains no bootstrap JSON or access-provider credentials.

The installer accepts `--bootstrap-env <NAME>` and uses the same enrollment command. It installs a private CLI and supplies `~/.local/bin/bb` without replacing an existing path. Non-login transports can use `command -v bb` with `~/.local/bin/bb` as a fallback. Linux machines without a systemd user session run a detached daemon; systemd and launchd machines receive a persistent service.

Machine bootstrap v2 supplies optional server request headers. `bb machine enroll`
persists them privately as `serverHeaders`; the launcher passes `BB_SERVER_HEADERS`
to the daemon for enrollment, connection and runtime requests. Server-access
plugins redeem provider codes on the server. Pending encrypted v1 bundles are
upgraded by the server when prepared again.

Delivered enrollment bundles from v1 remain valid until their expiry. The CLI accepts both file and environment forms, upgrades the bundle to v2 headers locally, and persists legacy Connect redemption before enrollment so a retry reuses it. The installer upgrades v1 environment bundles before authenticated artifact downloads.

## DigitalOcean dev boxes

`bb digitalocean configure <host-id> '<config-json>'` sets `idleMinutes` (null
turns idle stop off), `retention` (default 2), and `schedule` (null disables;
otherwise `weekdays` 0–6, `sleep`/`wake` HH:mm, and explicit IANA `timezone`).
`bb digitalocean snapshot-now <host-id>` drains through core, gracefully shuts
down, confirms off, snapshots and remains off. `sleep` does the same; `wake`
resumes through core. Busy threads and open terminals prevent sleep. Core also
wakes on dispatch. Empty boxes participate in opt-in idle stop; retirement stays
never. `status` and `cost` show live inventory and estimates; all accept `--json`.
`bb machine show <host-id> --json` includes provider inventory in `providerDetails`.

Powered-off droplets still bill; snapshot storage bills per GB. See
https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/details/pricing/ and
https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/snapshots/details/pricing/ . Configure a
weekday schedule from the plugin settings or CLI on an always-on BB server.
The latest missed action within eight days runs after recovery; busy sleep
retries each minute until superseded. See the plugin skill for DST and cleanup.

Resume waits for any in-progress suspension before waking; an already-active
machine is left active. DigitalOcean sleep JSON retains saved power/backup
status if inventory is unavailable (`details.values.cost: null` and
`inventoryError`). Shared inventory reads cache for 30 seconds and invalidate
on mutations. Schedule changes invalidate selected, undispatched runs.

Create DigitalOcean dev boxes from Settings → Machines or
`bb machine create --provider digitalocean --inputs '{}' --json`, without a
project. SDK creation uses `machineProviderId: "digitalocean", projectId: null,
inputs: {}`. Enrolled boxes appear as machine sections in the composer picker;
DigitalOcean contributes no new-machine/project-checkout shortcut row.

Existing machines

`bb machine create --provider manual` waits for a private enrollment command,
prints it once, and follows the host until the daemon connects. Run that command on the target
machine; it installs bb if needed. Server access is resolved through the selected
default access provider, just like SSH or cloud machines. `--no-wait` returns the
creating host ID. The CLI prints the enrollment command and its expiry while it
follows. This command is built transiently from the in-memory pending bundle;
durable host progress contains no credential. After enrollment or removal, the
host-keyed command endpoint returns no command. Treat it as a credential.

Use `bb machine show <host-id>` to recover progress and
`bb machine remove <host-id>` to cancel and revoke enrollment/access. Stopping
the CLI or closing the dialog only stops following; creation continues.
Manual machines never idle-suspend or automatically retire and do not expose
suspend/resume. Removing one revokes its server access without executing on the
machine. Run the original installer with `--uninstall --host-id <host-id>` on that box, with its
original `BB_DATA_DIR` if explicitly configured, to remove its installation.

## Machine environment

Repository setup receives freshly resolved machine variables on each dispatch,
including recovery. Values are sent transiently to the setup process and are
not stored in provisioning requests. Existing attached paths skip setup.

`bb machine env list --json` lists global machine variables and built-in GitHub
health. `bb machine env set NAME [--note text] --json` reads its value
from stdin, removing one trailing newline; values are never accepted in argv.
`bb machine env unset NAME --json` removes an override. All values are encrypted in the database and never returned by list or set.

Settings → Machines → Machine environment edits variables inline. Add, remove,
or import .env rows, then Save variables; Discard changes leaves saved values
untouched. Saved secrets can be replaced but never revealed. The automatic
GH_TOKEN row shows server login health; a custom GH_TOKEN overrides it. User variables
override built-in values for all enrolled machine hosts, excluding local hosts.
Agent-provider variables win over these host values for agent turns. The server synchronizes these values into the daemon environment at connection
and whenever settings change. Background commands and newly launched processes
inherit them, including git and gh operations. Removing an override restores the
original daemon value. Existing processes and terminals retain their launch
environment. Environment synchronization does not restart cached provider
runtimes; they retain their launch environment until recreated. Runtime output is forwarded as-is,
so commands and providers can print contributed values.

Plugin host calls start immediately using the current environment while any calls
are active in that plugin worker. Changed or removed machine variables take
effect on the next call after all active calls finish. Continuous overlapping
calls can keep the previous values until the worker becomes idle.

The server's gh login provides GitHub credentials, a Git environment-only HTTPS
helper and SSH rewrites, and commit identity. The built-in row reports logged in,
not logged in, or overridden. No credentials are installed in images or global
Git config. SDK: system.machineEnvironment() and
system.replaceMachineEnvironment({ variables }). Replacement is atomic; pass
every row to retain, using value: null for an unchanged saved secret.

Thread startup does not install or update agent CLIs, probe authentication, or validate workspace fingerprints. Core runs repository setup when creating an owned environment and teardown before removing it. Resume does not rerun setup.

`bb machine list --json` includes lifecycle phase, progress, and any suspension or resume error.
Maintenance interrupts active turns and closes terminals before saving. Submit a
new continuation turn after restore; interrupted turns are never reported successful.

Resuming a machine restores its provider state without rerunning environment setup.

Automatic machine GitHub credentials are enabled by default. Use
`bb settings general machineGitCredentialsEnabled false` to stop forwarding the
server gh credentials to machines; `true` enables them again. In Machines →
Advanced settings, the automatic GH_TOKEN switch controls the same setting.
This does not log the server out or suppress an explicit custom GH_TOKEN.
Changes apply to new turns, setup commands and terminals.

Manual enrollment commands display the server expiry timestamp as a countdown.
After expiry, Add a machine offers Generate new command: it cancels the old
attempt and creates a fresh one. Manual owns the command and expiry in memory;
polling does not renew it. Restart machine setup if the plugin or server restarts.

For a new thread on a new Modal sandbox, select the environment composition:
`bb thread spawn --project <id> --environment-provider modal-sandbox --prompt "..."`.
It creates the machine, prepares the project checkout, and runs environment setup.
Progress and failures appear in the thread's provisioning details. If cloning
fails, the machine remains available for retry or explicit removal.
`--new-machine <id>` requires an explicit `--environment-provider <id>`; machine
providers do not implicitly choose an environment.
