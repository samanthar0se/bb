/**
 * A change to the published plugin SDK surface must bump PLUGIN_SDK_VERSION.
 *
 * Pre-1.0 the major is the compatibility number and never moves for additive
 * work, so the patch is the only thing a plugin author can point
 * `engines.bbPluginSdk` at to say "I need a host new enough to have this" —
 * `isPluginSdkRangeSatisfied` reads that range as a floor within the major.
 * Ship a new export without a bump and a plugin using it has no version to
 * require, so installing it on an older bb fails at runtime instead of
 * legibly at load.
 *
 * Nothing else catches this: `version.test.ts` only checks that package.json
 * and the constant agree with each other, and `app-contract.ts` has no
 * enumerated export list the way the backend, rpc, and host contracts do.
